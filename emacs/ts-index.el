  "`ts-index-find` shows global typescript artifacts of the current project.

The helm candidates look like this:
ce MyClass my-class.ts

The first character indicates the artifact type. Right now the
following types are possible:

c - class
e - enum
f - function
i - interface
m - module
t - type
v - variable

The second character indicates if the artifact is exported via an
e character. - indicates it is not exported.

The status characters are followed by the name of the artifact in
a second column.

The file name in where the artifact was found is the third
column.

Invoking this function will create a buffer with a name like
'*<projectname> ts-index*' which launches a ts-index process in
order to scan the project's files. Kill the buffer if you don't
need the index anymore.

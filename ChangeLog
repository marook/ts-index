	* ts-index.el (ts-index-import-functions): The hook changed it's
	expectations regarding it's functions because ts-index tries now
	to insert imports in the right place instead at point. Therefore
	the hook functions must return either a list of imported artifact
	name and imported path or otherwise nil if the hook can't perform
	the import. ts-index will use the returned name and path to merge
	the import into the existing imports it possible.
